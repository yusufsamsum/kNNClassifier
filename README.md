# kNNClassifier
This repository includes Bilkent University Introduction to Machine Learning course assignment. The problem definition is given below:

*Biological sciences are becoming data-rich and information-intensive. Machine learning applications have become very useful and popular tools for resolving important questions in biology by enabling to analyze vast amount of biological information. In this question, you will be introduced to one of the biological data sets, DrugBank, and gain intuition of feasibility of kNN algorithm using this data set.*

## Dataset

The data set contains their 4765 unique proteins and 136 unique drugs that target those proteins [1]. Your job is to predict whether a protein is pharmacologically active, i.e. directly related to the mechanism of action for at least one of the associated drugs, or not by using the target information of drugs.

### Data files are:

- question-3-train-features.csv
- question-3-train-labels.csv
- question-3-valid-features.csv
- question-3-valid-labels.csv
- question-3-train-protein-index.csv 
- question-3-valid-protein-index.csv 
- question-3-drug-index.csv

** Since data files can be over 25 MB and github does not allow to upload the files, the question's files can be found via that link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MY7rvgYp4YJxrqO1NEy6gWqwxwGHvZ3g 

## Program
 kNN implementation had used for the training and validation sets.
